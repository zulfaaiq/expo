This website is a project submission to meet the graduation criteria for the basic web programming class at Dicoding. For this project, I received a 5-star review because it met the basic criteria and implemented all the suggestions, including:

1. Including <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>, and <aside> elements in the HTML file.
2. Ensuring that each element contains content relevant to its purpose, applying semantic HTML concepts in structuring the website's layout.
3. Displaying a photo within the <aside> element. You can choose to showcase your own photo along with additional biodata or select a relevant image related to the content you've written.
4. Creating the layout using flexbox instead of float.
5. Implementing an attractive application interface.
6. Ensuring a responsive layout.
7. Incorporating JavaScript for DOM manipulation. Here are some examples of JavaScript implementations.

For the design inspiration of the website, I referred to https://preview.colorlib.com/#expo but I made modifications to align it with the submission criteria.
